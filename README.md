## Hi there 👋  

I'm **Cinthya Criollo**, an Artificial Intelligence student at the **University of Amsterdam**, currently focusing on **AI research and model fine-tuning**.  
My interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning, model alignment, and data-driven system design**.  

---

### 🔭 Projects  
-  **Medical Image Segmentation Thesis**, exploring model performance with **MedSAM** and **UniverSeg** for cross-domain generalization.  
-  **Research Collaboration: [LLaMA 2 7B Fine-tuning Study](https://github.com/khna89/nlp2_project)**, compared **In-Context Learning (ICL)**, **QLoRA**, and **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** to evaluate human preference alignment.  
  Conducted within the **Natural Language Processing-2** course at the **University of Amsterdam**, in collaboration with [@khna89](https://github.com/khna89).
- Currently working on a [Sick-plant Detector]. Please, check the repository: (https://github.com/cc1528/plant-health-ai)
